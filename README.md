Example stream processing big data algorithm using Apache Spark

This is a lab assignment by SE346

Implementation of several stream processing algorithm for big data will be demonstrated using **Graphx** from Apache Spark

- Single source shortest path problem(SSSP)
- Google's PageRank
- Simple WordCount application using Streaming processing from multiple nodes using map-reduce
- Line count application using map-reduce with Graphx
